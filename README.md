#PSA4-5043 LNA with onboard Bias tee designed for use with RTL SDR dongles, hackrf, or other SDR. LNA has two power options, USB mini or power from inline. There is also an option for an on-board wideband bias tee and bandpass filter.

"The current board design needs a series resistor between J1 and LED1 in order for the LED to operate. I will redesign the board soon to accommodate the changes. If you have the current board design, the trace can be cut betweeen the components and a 470ohm resistor can be put in its place."
